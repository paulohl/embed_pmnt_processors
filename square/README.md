To get your production access token
===================================

1. In the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/apps), open your application. If you do not have a Square account, you need to create one.
2. At the top of the page, in the Sandbox and Production toggle, choose Production.
3. On the Credentials page, under Production Access Token, choose Show, and then copy the token. The token grants full access to the resources in your account.

Use your access token to test your calls to the Snippets API and Sites API from your management dashboard. 
After you call UpsertSnippet to add or update the snippet to your test site, you can test the snippet functionality from your site.

The [Square App Marketplace](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/oauth-api/overview) can help Square sellers discover your application. When your application is ready, you can submit it for approval to the App Marketplace. 
For more information, see [Publish your App to the App Marketplace](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/app-marketplace).
